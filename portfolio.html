                    I initially joined as a FrontEnd developer, focusing on ADA
                    compliance, adding new pages, and implementing buttons. As I
                    gained a deeper understanding of the app's architecture and
                    backend, I transitioned into a FullStack Developer role.

                  <div id="project1ReadMore" class="MoreText hidden">
                    I joined this project when the senior developer transitioned
                    from Twilio to
                    <a class="linkInDescription" href="https://telnyx.com/">

                    for the audio/video meeting client. He helped me understand
                    the project, and in turn, I assisted him with the frontend
                    aspects of the migration.
                    <br />
                    During ADA compliance work, I enhanced navigation using the
                    TAB key for elderly users. I reformatted code to improve
                    accessibility, added additional titles and descriptions to
                    components for a better user experience with screen readers,
                    and made text and elements more readable. On the backend, I
                    addressed issues related to sending emails, screen sharing,
                    mute/unmute functionality, and implemented a feature to
                    limit the group size of a video conference.
                    <br />
                    Resumed my involvement in this project in September 2023,
                    addressing bugs and incorporating small features. Introduced
                    a monitoring feature to track user experience, recording
                    instances such as prolonged response times, timeouts,
                    external errors (e.g., failed to fetch, network errors,
                    Telnyx errors), reconnects, and unusual events from phone
                    users.

                    Developed new pages and functionalities for schools, such as
                    adding and reviewing lesson plans, implementing super user
                    login, granting permissions to other pages, creating
                    sortable and filterable tables, and enabling keyword
                    searches for lesson plans. Additionally, I worked on
                    features like synchronizing the application's database with
                    the Edlinks database, implementing forms, pagination,
                    enabling the addition of files from Google Drive, and
                    incorporating YouTube videos as attachments to lesson plans.
                    Implemented notifications for changes in lesson plans.
                    <br />
                    Notably, this application is currently designed with a
                    teacher-centric focus and does not include features for
                    students.
                    <br />
                    Tasked with developing a feature to add US state standards
                    to lesson plans, allowing teachers to choose and link
                    specific state standards and update them. Also, implemented
                    a calendar feature to showcase lesson plans based on the
                    scheduled teaching date, accommodating different time zones
                    associated with the school.
                    <br />
                    Implemented functionality to include schools that do not use
                    a Learning Management System (LMS), such as Google Classroom
                    or Canvas, into our application.

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>
                      I conducted research on implementing a calendar component
                      to display lesson plans over periods of time. I opted for
                      the
                      <a
                        href="https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html?path=/story/about-big-calendar--page"
                        class="linkInDescription"
                        >react-big-calendar</a
                      >
                      and created custom event components to represent lesson
                      plans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Additionally, I was tasked with adding an attachment
                      feature to an assignment. For this, I chose the
                      <a
                        href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-drive"

                        >Google Drive library</a
                      >. Initially, I faced a challenge as it required a key on
                      the frontend, raising security concerns about its
                      visibility after bundling the app. However, it turned out
                      not to be an issue since Google Drive keys are linked to
                      Google App Key and the domain they are used on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To avoid logging into Google to access the Google Drive
                      window, I used the Google login key, which was stored in
                      cookies after logging into the base app.
